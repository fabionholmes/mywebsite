    <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a proactive and technically skilled Technical Support Specialist with 18 months of hands-on experience in IT support and proprietary robotic systems. Currently, I am advancing my expertise in Python, PowerShell, and Networking. As I prepare to relocate from London to Birmingham in October 2024, I am seeking a role that allows me to apply my technical skills, contribute to innovative projects, and further my career in the IT sector.</p>
    <p>This page was created to provide a more in-depth look at my experience and education</p>

    <h1 id="management">Management</h1>
    <p>During my time at Ocado Technology, I had the opportunity to lead my team during two three-month rotations when we were without a team leader. This experience allowed me to step up, assuming the leadership responsibilities.</p>
    <p>This experience was invaluable, as it allowed me to further hone my management skills in a role where I was already confident and well-established.</p>

    <h1 id="highlited-projects">Highlighted Projects</h1>
    <p>SICK Scanner Repairs: I developed and maintained comprehensive documentation for SICK Scanner repairs, ensuring all processes are clearly outlined for future reference. This then led to me spearheading a project focused on the repair and maintenance of SICK Scanners, resulting in reduced costs and improved operational efficiency.
    <br><br>NUC Cleaning Project: This project aimed was at cleaning and maintaining NUC devices, which improved their performance and extended their lifespan.
    <br><br>intune_cfc5_uk Groups: I managed and organized Intune groups, ensuring proper configuration and compliance across devices.
    <br><br>OSS CCTV Tool: I used python to develop a tool to streamline the management and monitoring of our CCTV systems.
