                <h2 id = "axel-electrical">Axel Electrical - Electrical Apprentice</h2>
                    <p>I spent 11 months on an electrical apprenticeship with this company. The majority of the work was based in London and we had projects of all different sizes.<br>Our main focus was fire detection and life safety systems, however, we also completed projects on CCTV, audio visual systems, site temporaries and general electrical installations (e.g. ring and radial circuits, lighting, LED lighting etc).</p>
                <h2 id = "murphys">J Murphy & Sons Ltd - Ground Worker/Labourer</h2>
                    <p> took part in a Government Kickstart Scheme which consisted of 6 months of groundwork at a 132kV substation in Barking Riverside. I spent time working alongside the Project Managers, which helped me gain an understanding of how a building site is coordinated.<br>Through J. Murphy’s & Sons, I was able to undertake a variety of courses which helped me broaden my skill set. During the 6 months I was working with multiple different trades and assisting them in their work:</p>

                            <li>Groundworkers - Laying ducting for cables and covering them with CBS (Cement Bound Sand) followed by stokboards, dirt, tape tiles and then type 2 stone.</li><br>
                            <li>Machine Drivers - I was taught how to be a banksman and some of the signals they use. I was also taught what to look out for when excavating and was often tasked with looking out for hazards and hand digging around potential dangers.</li><br>
                            <li>Electricians - Pulling armoured cables and keeping the routes for each run clear due to different voltage cables being in a close proximity of one another.</li><br>
                            <li>Carpenters - Helping with the formwork for the cable entry to the new substation as well as pouring the concrete and ensuring there were no air bubbles or spillages.</li><br>
                            <li>Project Managers - Ensuring that there was the correct amount of plant and materials on site at the start of each week and ensuring that all unused equipment was off-hired as soon as possible and filling in the forms to keep a record of this.</li>
